# Variable Scope
Question 1
What will the following code log to the console and why? 
```js
let num = 5;

function myFunc() {
  num = 10;
}

myFunc();
console.log(num);
```
This logs `10` to the console. The variable `num` declared and initialized to `5` on line 1 is accessible within the scope of the `myFunc` function. When that function is invoked, `num` is reassigned.
***

Question 2
What will the following code log to the console and why? 
```js
let num = 5;

function myFunc() {
  console.log(num);
  num = 10;
}

myFunc();
console.log(num);
```
This first logs `5` to the console, and then logs `10` to the console. The variable `num` declared and initialized to `5` on line 1 is accessible within the scope of the `myFunc` function. When that function is invoked it first logs the value of `num`, which at this point in execution is `5`, and then reassigns `num` to `10`. The reassigned value is then logged on the last line of the code snippet.

Question 3
```js
let num = 5;

function myFunc() {
  let num = 10;
}

myFunc();
console.log(num);
```
Solution 3
This logs `5` to the console. The variable `num` is declared and initialized to `5` on line 1. When the function is executed, however, another variable called `num` is declared and initialized within the scope of the function. The key thing here is that line 4 is the initialization of a new variable rather than the reassignment of the variable from line 1.

Question 4
What will the following code log to the console and why? 
```js
let num = 5;

function myFunc() {
  console.log(num);
  let num = 10;
}

myFunc();
console.log(num);
```
Solution 4
This won't log anything to the console. Instead, this code will raise a `ReferenceError`. The `let` declaration on line `5` creates a new num variable within the scope of the body of the `myFunc` function. The console.log on line 4 is attempting to log the value of that `num` variable, not the one declared and initialized on line one. Since the variable hasn't been initialized yet however, we get a reference error:

Question 5
What will the following code log to the console and why? 
```js
let num = 5;

function myFunc(num) {
  num = 10;
}

myFunc();
console.log(num);
```
Solution 5
This logs `5` to the console. When the `myFunc` function is invoked, due to the function parameter `num` JavaScript creates a new variable `num` within the scope of the function. This variable blocks access to the variable of the same name declared and initialized in the global scope on line 1. That variable cannot therefore be reassigned by the function and so retains its initial value of `5`, which is what is logged.

Question 6
What will the following code log to the console and why? 
```js
let num = 1;

while (num < 3) {
  num += 1;
}

console.log(num);
```
Solution 6
This logs `3` to the console.  The variable `num` declared and initialized on line 1 is incremented by 1 within the while loop on line 4 (this line essentially reassigns num to a new value, which is its current value added to 1). This happens twice, while `num` is less then `3` and so the condition for the `while` loop to execute is met. Once `num` reaches `3`, the while loop no longer runs and so program execution continues to the console.log on line 7, which logs the reassigned value of `num`.

Question 7
What will the following code log to the console and why? 
```js
let num = 1;

while (num < 3) {
  let num = 5;
  num += 1;
}

console.log(num);
```
Solution 7
This doesn't log anything to the console. This code results in an infinite loop, which will eventually time out. Line 4 declares and initializes a variable `num` to the number `5`. This is a different variable to the `num` declared and initialized to 1 on line 1, and exists within the scope of the block defined by the curly braces; it is this `num` that is incremented on line 5. The condition for the while loop, however, references the `num` declared on line 1, not the one within the scope of the block. The condition for ending the while loop is therefore never met, resulting in an infinite loop.

# Objects vs. Primitives

Question 1
What will the following code log to the console and why? 

```js
let myWord = 'Hello';
myWord.concat(' there.');

console.log(myWord);
```

Solution 1
This logs the string `'Hello'`.

The `myWord` variable is assigned to a string, which as a primitive is immutable. Calling concat on the string returns a new string with the string there. appended to it. This doesn't affect the original string, and we don't do anything with the return value.

Question 2
What will the following code log to the console and why? 

```js
let myWord = 'Hello';
myWord.repeat(3);
console.log(myWord);
myWord.replace('H', 'J');
console.log(myWord);
myWord.toUpperCase();
console.log(myWord);
```
Solution 2
Each of the `console.log()` invocations logs the string` 'Hello'`. This is the same string in each case, and it isn't affected by any of the intervening method invocations `(repeat, replace, and toUpperCase)`, each of which return a new string but don't have any effect on the original string, which is immutable. It doesn't matter which String methods we call on the string, or in which order. Strings, being primitive values, are immutable.

Question 3
What will the following code log to the console and why? 
```js
let myWords = ['Hello'];
myWords.push('Goodbye');

console.log(myWords);
```
Solution 3
This logs `[ 'Hello', 'Goodbye' ]` to the console. The value assigned to the `myWords` variable is an array. Arrays are objects and therefore mutable. The `Array.push` method mutates the array by adding an element to it, so that when we log `myWords` we get the mutated array.

Question 4
What will the following code log to the console and why? 

```js
let myWords = ['Hello'];
myWords.concat(['Goodbye']);

console.log(myWords);
```

Solution 4
This logs `[ 'Hello' ] `to the console. Although `myWords` is assigned to an array, which is an object and therefore mutable, the `Array.concat` method doesn't mutate the array it is called on; it instead returns a new array. 

Question 5
What will the following code log to the console and why? 
```js
let myWords = ['Hello'];
myWords[0].toUpperCase();

console.log(myWords);
```

Solution 5
This logs `[ 'Hello' ]` to the console. Although myWords is assigned to an array, which is an object and therefore mutable, we're actually calling the `toUpperCase()` method on the string at index `0` of the array. Being primitive types, strings are immutable, so the method has no effect on the string (it instead returns a new string), and we're not mutating the array or changing the value at index `0`.

Question 6
What will the following code log to the console and why? 
```js
let myWords = ['Hello'];
myWords[0] = myWords[0].toUpperCase();

console.log(myWords);
```

This logs `[ 'HELLO' ] `to the console. Unlike the previous example, here we are mutating the array by changing the value at index `0`. It's important to note that we aren't mutating the original string, but instead setting the value at index `0` to a new string returned by calling `String.prototype.toUpperCase` on the original string.


# Variables as Pointers

What will the following code log to the console and why? 
```js
let myWord = 'Hello';
let myOtherWord = myWord;

console.log(myWord);
console.log(myOtherWord);
```
Solution 1
This logs the string `'Hello'` twice.

The `myWord` variable is initialized to the string '`Hello`'. On line 2, we assign `myOtherWord` to `myWord`. At this point, both variables point to a string with the value of `'Hello'`; it's important to note though, even though the strings have the same value they are different strings stored at different memory addresses.

Question 2
What will the following code log to the console and why? 
```js
let myWord = 'Hello';
let myOtherWord = myWord;
myWord = 'Goodbye';

console.log(myWord);
console.log(myOtherWord);
```
Solution 2
This logs the string `'Goodbye'` and then the string `'Hello'`.

This is very similar to Exercise 1 with one key difference: on line 3 we reassign `myWord` to the string `'Goodbye'`. In JavaScript, primitive values are stored directly in the variable’s memory space. When you assign a primitive value to a variable, a new copy of that value is created and stored at a specific memory address associated with that variable. Therefore, when you assign `‘Hello’ `to `myWord` and then assign `myWord` to `myOtherWord`, both variables `myWord` and `myOtherWord` hold separate copies of the value `‘Hello’` located at different memory addresses.

Question 3
What will the following code log to the console and why? 
```js
let myWords = ['Hello', 'Goodbye'];
let myOtherWords = myWords;
myWords[0] = 'Hi';

console.log(myWords);
console.log(myOtherWords);
```
Solution 3

This will log` ['Hi', 'Goodbye']` twice. `myWords` points to a reference which points to this `['Hello', 'Goodbye']` array in memory. Then `myOtherWords` is declared and assigned `myWords`. At this point both variables point to the same array in memory location. When `mywords[0] = 'Hi'` is executed `'Hi' `is assigned to the `0` index of `mywords` array. In other words, the first element of `myWords` is changed to `'Hi'`. When both variables are logged, the change is appeared in both variables because they both point to the same array reference and arrays, being objects are mutable.

Question 4
What will the following code log to the console and why? 
```js
let myWords = ['Hello', 'Goodbye'];
let myOtherWords = myWords;
myWords = ['Hi', 'Bye'];

console.log(myWords);
console.log(myOtherWords);
Solution 4
This logs the array [ 'Hi', 'Bye' ], and then the array ['Hello', 'Goodbye'].

As with Exercise 3, we're again dealing with a reference type. Again, after line 2, both variables have as their value the memory address where the array is stored. In this exercise though, line 3 reassigns the myWords variable to a different value. In this case we're reassigning it to another array, but we could equally have reassigned it to a primitive value. The important point is that the variable now points to a different value and so the two variables no longer have the same value (the memory address where the ['Hello', 'Goodbye'] array is stored). When we log each variable, different values are therefore output.

Question 5
What will the following code log to the console and why? 
```js
let myWords = ['Hello', 'Goodbye'];
let myWord = myWords[0];
myWords[0] = 'Hi';

console.log(myWords);
console.log(myWord);
```
Solution 5
This logs the array `[ 'Hi', 'Goodbye' ]`, and then the string` 'Hello'`.

On line 1 we declare and initialize the variable `myWords` to an array containing two elements, the strings `'Hello'` and `'Goodbye'`.
On line 2 we declare and initialize another variable, `myWord`, to the element at index `0` of the array referenced by `myWords`, which is the string `'Hello'`. Because that string is a primitive type, index `0` of the array and the `myWord` variable each reference different strings at different memory addresses, even though those strings have the same value.
On line 3 we reassign index `0` of the `myWords` array to a new value, the string` 'Hi'`. This changes the value stored at index `0` of the array, but has no effect on the value stored by the `myWord` variable.
When we log the value of `myWords` and `myWord` on line 5 and 6, we can see that the `myWords` array has the string `'Hi'` at index `0` and `myWord` has a value of `'Hello'`.

Question 6
What will the following code log to the console and why? 
```js
let myWords = ['Hello', 'Goodbye'];
let myWord = 'Hi';
myWords[0] = myWord;
myWord = 'Hello';

console.log(myWords);
console.log(myWord);
```
Solution 6
This logs the array `[ 'Hi', 'Goodbye' ]`, and then the string `'Hello'`.

We again begin with a `myWords` initialized to an array containing two elements, the strings `'Hello'` and `'Goodbye'`. In this case though we assign `myWord` to the string `'Hi'`, and then set the element at index `0` of the `myWords` array to the value of `myWord` before reassigning `myWord` to the string `'Hello'`.

The principles at work are the same in both exercises. The values we are dealing with are primitives, and the value of these primitive values are stored at different memory addresses. Changing the value of one does not affect the other.


# Pass by reference vs Pass by value

Question 1
What will the following code log to the console and why? 

```js
function changeMyWord(word) {
  console.log(word);
  word = word.toUpperCase();
}

let myWord = 'Hello';
changeMyWord(myWord);
console.log(myWord);
Solution 1
This logs 'Hello' to console twice.
```
The function changeMyWord defines one parameter word. It logs the value of that parameter to the console, and then reassigns word to the return value of word.toUpperCase(), which, in this case, is 'HELLO'.

On line 6, the variable myWord is declared and initialized to the String 'Hello'. On line 7, we pass in myWord as an argument to the changeMyWord function invocation. At this point, both the myWord variable and the word function parameter have as their value the String 'Hello', so when the changeMyWord function logs the value of word, 'Hello' is logged to console. Crucially though, because we are dealing with a primitive value, the myWord variable and the word function parameter point to different places in memory.

Essentially, passing in myWord as an argument to the changeMyWord function invocation acts like pass-by-value. Because of this, nothing we do with the word parameter in the function, such as calling toUpperCase() on it and re-assigning word, will have any effect on the value of the myWord variable. Therefore, when we log we log the value of `myWord` `Hello` is output. 

Question 2
What will the following code log to the console and why? 

```js
function changeMyWord(word) {
  console.log(word);
  word = word.toUpperCase();
  return word;
}

let myWord = 'Hello';
myWord = changeMyWord(myWord);
console.log(myWord);
```
Solution 2
This logs 'Hello' to console once, and 'HELLO' to console once.

This example is very similar to Example 1, with two key differences:

The changeMyWord function returns the value of the word parameter.
The myWord variable is reassigned to that returned value.
It's the combination of these two things that leads to the difference in output here compared to Example 1. Because we're effectively using pass-by-value here, the only way to impact the value of the myWord variable outside the scope of the function is by returning something from the function. Just returning a value is not sufficient on its own, however, we also have to do something with that value such as assigning it to a variable.

Question 3
What will the following code log to the console and why? 

```js
function changeMyWord(word) {
  console.log(word);
  word = word.toUpperCase();
  return word;
}

let myWord = 'Hello';
let myOtherWord = changeMyWord(myWord);
console.log(myWord);
console.log(myOtherWord);
```
Solution 3
This logs 'Hello' to console twice, and 'HELLO' to console once.

This is similar to Exercise 2. The key difference is that rather than reassigning myWord to the return value of the changeMyWord function invocation, we're declaring and initializing another variable myOtherWord to that return value. Therefore when we log myWord it still has its initial value of 'Hello', and only when we log myOtherWord do we see the value of 'HELLO' returned by the function.

This again demonstrates that nothing we do within the changeMyWord function will affect the value of the String primitive assigned to the myWord variable. We can use the value returned by the function, but only by assigning a variable to it, or reassigning an existing variable. It's important to draw a distinction between the process of assignment and reassignment of variables and the concept of mutability.
Question 4
What will the following code log to the console and why? 

```js
function changeMyWords(words) {
  console.log(words);
  words[0] = 'Hi';
}

let myWords = ['Hello', 'Goodbye'];
changeMyWords(myWords);
console.log(myWords);
```
Solution 4
This will log ['Hello', 'Goodbye'] and then ['Hi', 'Goodbye'] to the console.

In this exercise, the myWords variable is initialized to an array containing two elements, the strings 'Hello' and 'Goodbye'. Because an array is a reference type rather than a primitive, when we pass myWords into the changeMyWords function invocation, this acts like pass-by-reference. The myWords variable and the words function parameter both point to the same array. When we initially log words on line 2 we see the same array elements from the array literal to which we initialized myWords. We then mutate the array on line 3 by assigning index 0 to the string 'Hi'. When we subsequently log myWords on line 8, we see the mutated array.

Question 5
What will the following code log to the console and why? 

```js
function changeMyWords(words) {
  console.log(words);
  words = ['Hi', 'Goodbye'];
}

let myWords = ['Hello', 'Goodbye'];
changeMyWords(myWords);
console.log(myWords);
```
Solution 5
This will log ['Hello', 'Goodbye'] twice.

This might look similar to Exercise 4, but the key difference is what happens on line 3. As with the previous exercise, when myWords is passed as an argument to the changeMyWords function invocation, it acts like pass-by-reference since myWords is assigned to an array. At this point the myWords variable and the words function parameter both point to the same array, and it is this array that is output when we log words on line 2. On line 3, however, we reassign the words parameter to a new array. Again, it's important to be clear that this reassignment is not the same thing as mutating the array. In this exercise, we don't mutate the array at any point, and so when we log myWords on line 8 we see the array with its original elements.


# Variables, Functions, and Blocks
## Examples

Example 1
```js
let myVar = 1;

function myFunc() {
  myVar = 2;
}

myFunc();
console.log(myVar); // 2
```
Explanation

This one is fairly straightforward. In this example, the variable myVar is declared and initialized to the number 1 on line 1. This variable is accessible within the scope of the function body of the myFunc function, and so on line 4 we can reassign the myVar variable to the number 2.

This reassignment occurs when we invoke myFunc on line 7, and so when myVar is logged on line 8 the reassigned value is output.

Example 2
```js
let myVar = [1];

function myFunc() {
  myVar = [2];
}

myFunc();
console.log(myVar); // [2]
```
Explanation

This example is essentially the same as Example 1. We initialize the variable myVar to particular value, in this case an array, on line 1. We then reassign the variable when the myFunc function is invoked on line 7.

The concept at work here is the same: the fact that myVar is accessible within the scope of the function body. The fact that myVar was initialized to a reference type value rather than a primitive value has no bearing on the outcome. It's important to note that we're not mutating the array in any way here, and that the array logged on line 8 is a different array to the one we initialized myVar to on line 1.

Example 3
```js
let myVar = [1];

function myFunc() {
  myVar[0] = 2;
}

myFunc();
console.log(myVar); // [2]
```
Explanation

The outcome here may seem the same as in Example 2, but there's a key difference here: the array logged on line 8 is the same array that myVar is initialized to on line 1.

Variable scope is still playing its part in that we can access the myVar variable within the scope defined by body of the myFunc function, but there's also another concept at work: mutability. ON line 4, rather than reassigning the myVar variable to a different array, we're mutating the array itself by assigning a different element to index 0 of the array.

Example 4
```js
let myVar = 1;

function myFunc(myVar) {
  myVar = 2;
}

myFunc();
console.log(myVar); // 1
```
Explanation

At first glance, this example may look identical to Example 1. There's a key difference, however, which is the function parameter myVar on line 3. It's this small detail that leads to the difference in outcome when the code is run.

The concept at work here is variable scope. When the myFunc function is invoked on line 7, JavaScript declares a variable with the name of the parameter myVar within the scope of the function. This is a different variable to the one initialized on line 1, and initially has a value of undefined. The existence of this variable within the scope of the function 'shadows', or blocks access to, the myVar variable in the global scope on line 1. Therefore, line 4 is a reassignment of the function-scoped myVar rather than a reassignment of the myVar declared and initialized on line 1. When that variable is then logged on line 8, it still has its initial value of 1.

Example 5
```js
let myVar = [1];

function myFunc(myVar) {
  myVar = [2];
}

myFunc();
console.log(myVar); // [1]
```
Explanation

This is essentially the same as Example 4. Although it looks similar to Example 2, again a different myVar variable is being created within the scope of the myFunc function and blocking access to the one declared and initialized on line 1. Line 4 is therefore reassigning the function-scoped myVar to a new array (remember, the myVar parameter would have been initialized to undefined when myFunc is invoked on line 7 because it is given no arguments. Line 4 is a reassignment, not an initialization). Again, the fact that we are dealing with a reference rather than a primitive plays no part here.

Example 6
```js
let myVar = [1];

function myFunc(myVar) {
  myVar[0] = 2; // TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting '0')
}

myFunc();
console.log(myVar);
```
Explanation

As with the previous two examples (4 and 5), this is again a situation where the myVar variable scoped to the function blocks access to the myVar declared and initialized on line 1. The difference here is that we are attempting to mutate it as if it was referencing an array. As explained in example 4, however, at this point the function-scoped myVar has a value of undefined, which is a primitive value. Line 4 is essentially undefined[0] = 2; which JavaScript parses as an attempt to set a property 0 on undefined, which isn't possible, hence the TypeError.

Example 7
```js
let myVar = 1;

function myFunc(myVar) {
  myVar = 2;
}

myFunc(myVar);
console.log(myVar); // 1
```
Explanation

This is almost identical to Example 4, but with one small difference: here we are passing the myVar variable declared and initialized on line 1 as an argument to the myFunc function invocation on line 7. In this case, however, that doesn't make any difference to the outcome.

Because myVar on line 1 is initialized to a primitive value, passing it as an argument to the function acts like pass-by-value. The myVar on line 1 and the myVar scoped to the myFunc function both point to the value 1 but these are two different value 1s that exist at different points in memory. As a result of this, whatever we do to myVar within the scope of the funtion won't affect the value assigned to myVar on line 1.

The fact that we're passing in a primitive value doesn't really come into play in this example though. The primary concept at work is again scope, and for the same reasons outlined in example 4. The function parameter myVar acts like a local variable within the scope of the function, which blocks access to the myVar declared and initialized on line 1. Line 4 is therefore a reassignment of this function-scoped variable.

Example 8
```js
let myVar = [1];

function myFunc(myVar) {
  myVar = [2];
}

myFunc(myVar);
console.log(myVar); // [1]
```
Explanation

This is similar to Example 7, except that we're passing in a reference type as an argument to the function rather than a primitive. Therefore, when the function is initially executed, the myVar on line 1 and the function-scoped myVar both reference the same array.

The fact that we're dealing with a reference type, however, doesn't really come into play here, beacuse on line 4 we're reassigning the function-scoped myVar to a different array. In that sense, the underlying concepts at work are the same as in Example 7.

Example 9
```js
let myVar = [1];

function myFunc(myVar) {
  myVar[0] = 2;
}

myFunc(myVar);
console.log(myVar); // [2]
```
Explanation

As with Example 8, we're passing a reference type as an argument to a function invocation. So again, when the myFunc function is executed, the myVar on line 1 and the function-scoped myVar are both referencing the same array. Unlike Example 8, however, here we are mutating that array (rather than reassigning the function-scoped variable). When we log myVar on line 8, therefore, we get the mutated array output.

## Exercises
Question 1
What will the following code log to the console and why? 

```js
let color = "yellow";
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

function updateColors(colors) {
  colors.push(color);
}

updateColors(colors);
console.log(colors);
```
Solution 1
This logs the array `['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow']`.

We declare and initialize two variables:

1. On line 1, the variable color is declared and initialized to the string 'yellow'.
2. On line 2, the variable colors is declared and initialized to an array containing three strings, 'red', 'green', and 'blue'.

On lines 4-6 we declare the function updateColors. It defines one parameter colors, and within the body of the function calls the push method on that parameter, passing in the variable color. Note that the colors parameter 'shadows', or blocks access to, the colors variable declared in the global scope on line 2.

We invoke the updateColors function on line 8, passing in the colors variable declared on line 2 as an argument. Because the function defined the parameter colors, and because the variable we passed in as an argument points to a reference type value, the colors variable on line 2 and the colors parameter (essentially a variable scoped to the function) both point to the same array. Within function body we call push on this array and pass in the color variable (which the function can access) which has the value of the string 'yellow'. This modifies the array by appending this value as a new element in the array.

On line 9 we log the value of the colors variable declared on line 2. Since this variable points to the same array as the one referenced by the colors parameter in the function, we see the modified value output.

Question 2
What will the following code log to the console and why? 

```js
let color = "yellow";
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

function updateColors(colors, color) {
  colors.push(color);
}

updateColors(colors);
console.log(colors);
```
Solution 2
This logs the array `['red', 'green', 'blue', undefined]`.

The code in this example is almost identical to the code example in Exercise 1, with one key difference: the updateColors function defines a second parameter color. As with Exercise 1, the colors function parameter blocks access to the global colors variable. In the case though, the color function parameter also blocks access to the color global variable.

When we invoke the function, however, we only pass in one argument, the variable colors which references the array ['red', 'green', 'blue']. As before, we call the push method on this array, but rather than pass in the color global variable (which points to the string 'yellow') we instead pass in the color parameter. Since we didn't pass in an argument for color when invoking the function, this parameter has a value of undefined.

The array is still modified, as in Exercise 1, so when we log the colors global variable on line 9 we again see the modified value, but the last element is undefined instead of 'yellow'.

Question 3
What will the following code log to the console and why? 

```js
let color1 = "purple";
let color2 = "pink";
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

function updateColors(colors, color) {
  colors.push(color);
}

updateColors(colors, color1);
updateColors(colors, color2);
console.log(colors);
```
Solution 3
This logs the array `['red', 'green', 'blue', 'purple', 'pink']`.

As with Exercise 2, our updateColors function defines two parameters. In this example though, we pass in two arguments when invoking the function. We also invoke the function twice.

We again have a global variable, colors, initialized to an array containing three strings, 'red', 'green', and 'blue'. Here we also have the global variables color1 and color2 initialized to the strings 'purple' and 'pink' respectively.

On the first invocation of updateColors we pass in the colors variable as the first argument and color1 as the second argument. Within the scope of the function, the colors parameter references the same array to which the global colors variable on line 3 points, and the color parameter points to the string value 'purple'. The function mutates the array which colors references, appending the string 'purple'.

Since the global colors variable references the same array as the one we mutated within the function, if we were to log colors at this point (i.e. on line 10) we would see output the mutated array ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'purple']. Instead, however, we invoke the function for a second time. We again pass in the global colors variable as the first argument (remember that the array it references has been mutated, so at this point it has a value of ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'purple']), and as the second argument we pass in color2.

As with the first invocation, the colors parameter again references the same array to which the global colors variable points. The color parameter on this occasion has a value of 'pink', and this value is appended to the array.

Question 4
What will the following code log to the console and why? 

```js
let color1 = "purple";
let color2 = "pink";
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

function updateColors(colors, color) {
  colors.push(color);
  return colors;
}

let newColors = updateColors(colors, color1);
updateColors(newColors, color2);
console.log(colors);
```
Solution 4
As with Exercise 3, this again logs the array ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'purple', 'pink']. There's a difference here in that we return the value of the colors parameter when we invoke the function, and also declare and assign another global variable newColors to that return value. The underlying principles at work are the same, however.

When updateColors is first invoked, we pass in the global colors variable. colors references an array, which at this point has a value of ['red', 'green', 'blue']. We also pass in color1 which has a value of 'purple'. When the function is invoked on line 10, the color parameter is initialized to 'purple' and is appended to the array referenced by the colors parameter. At this point the array referenced by both the colors parameter and the global colors variable has a value of ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'purple']. We then return the value of the colors parameter.

On line 10, we declare and initialize the variable newColors to the return value of the function. Since, within the scope of the function, the colors parameter was assigned to a reference value, the value that the function returns (and hence the value to which newColors is assigned) is a reference to the array. So at this point, the global variables colors and newColors both reference the same array.

On line 11 we again invoke updateColors, passing in newColors as the first argument. We could have also passed in colors, since both variables reference the same array. For the second argument, we pass in color2, which has a value of 'pink'. Just as in Exercise 3, this value is appended to the array referenced by both colors and newColors.

Question 5
What will the following code log to the console and why? 

```js
let color = "purple";
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

function addColor(colors, color) {
  colors.push(color);
  return colors;
}

function removeColor(colors) {
  color = colors.pop();
  return colors;
}

let newColors = removeColor(colors);
addColor(colors, color);
console.log(newColors);
```
Solution 5
This logs the array `['red', 'green', 'blue']`.

In some ways this is similar to Exercise 4 except that here we have two functions, both of which mutate the array passed in.

We declare and initialize the global variable color to the string 'purple' on line 1. On line 2, we declare and initialize the global variable colors to an array containing three strings, 'red', 'green', and 'blue'.

We declare two functions:

1. `addColor` which defines two parameters colors and color. It calls push on colors passing in color as an argument and then returns colors.
2. `removeColor` which defines one parameter colors. It calls pop on colors and then returns colors. (Note that the colors object is mutated.)
On line 14 we invoke `removeColor`, passing in the global colors variable as an argument. At this point the colors parameter within the scope of the function and the global colors variable both point to the same array ['red', 'green', 'blue']. We then mutate that array by calling the Array method pop on it. This removes the last element of the array, so the array which the colors parameter and the global colors variable both reference now has a value of ['red', 'green']. The function returns a reference to this array, and it is this reference to which newColors is assigned.

A key aspect of this function though, is what happens on line 10. Here we assign color to the return value of colors.pop(). The pop method returns the element that it removes, so in this case that return value is the string 'blue'. What is color though? Since we haven't defined a color parameter, nor declared a new variable of that name within the scope of the function, we need to look outside of the function scope. The color referenced on line 10 is the global color variable that we declared on line 1. Line 10 is therefore a reassignment of this variable.

At this point, once we've invoked `removeColor`, the global color variable has a value of 'blue' and the global colors and newColors variables both point to the same array which has a value of ['red', 'green'].

We then invoke addColor on line 15, passing in the colors and color global variables. Within the scope of the function the colors parameter points to the same array as the global colors variable and the color parameter has the value of 'blue'. We then append the value of color to the array and return a reference to the colors array (though we don't do anything with the return value).

At this point the array to which the global colors and newColors variables both point has a value of `['red', 'green', 'blue']`, and so this is what is output when newColors is logged on line 16.

Question 6
What will the following code log to the console and why? 

```js
function capitalize() {
  return word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1);
}

function exclaim() {
  return (word += "!!!");
}

let word = "hello";
let capitalizedWord = capitalize(word);
let exclaimedWord = exclaim(capitalizedWord);

console.log(word);
console.log(capitalizedWord);
console.log(exclaimedWord);
```
Solution 6
This will log:

```js
hello!!!
Hello
hello!!!
```
Here we have two functions, capitalize and exclaim. Neither function define any parameters, but both return a value.

On line 9, we declare and initialize the global variable word to the string 'hello'.

On line 10, we declare and initialize the global variable capitalizedWord to the return value of invoking capitalize. Within the body of the function a few things happen:

We reference the first letter of word, which is 'h', using bracket notation and call the String method toUpperCase on it. This returns a new string 'H'.
We call the String method slice on word, passing in the index 1 as an argument. This returns a new string 'ello'.
We concatenate these two new strings using the + operator to form the new string 'Hello'.
We then return this string 'Hello', and so capitalizedWord is assigned to this value.
Note that although we passed in word as an argument to the function invocation, we don't use that argument within the function and the word referenced on line 2 is the global variable word. Since this variable is assigned to a primitive, however, nothing we do on line 2 changes it in any way.

On line 11, we invoke the exclaim function, passing in the capitalizedWord variable. As with the capitalize function invocation we don't use the argument within the function. Within the function, word references the global word variable that was declared on line 9. We reassign this variable to a value which is the initial value of word ('hello') concatenated using the + operator with the string '!!!' to produce a new string 'hello!!!'. As well as reassigning word to this new string, we also return it, assigning exclaimedWord to this value.

After our function invocations therefore, word and exclaimedWord have a value of 'hello!!!' and capitalizedWord has a value of 'Hello'. It is these values we see when we log the three variables on lines 13-15.

Question 7
What will the following code log to the console and why? 

```js
function capitalize(word) {
  return word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1);
}

function exclaim(word) {
  return (word += "!!!");
}

let word = "hello";
let capitalizedWord = capitalize(word);
let exclaimedWord = exclaim(capitalizedWord);

console.log(word);
console.log(capitalizedWord);
console.log(exclaimedWord);
```
Solution 7
This will log:

```js
hello
Hello
Hello!!!
```
At first glance this looks identical to Exercise 6, but there's a key difference: the capitalize and exclaim functions both define a function parameter word.

In the case of the capitalize function this parameter doesn't really make any difference to what happens. We pass in the global variable word as an argument to the function invocation, so the word parameter also has a value of 'hello' but at a different memory location. We then create a new string 'Hello' in the same way as before (concatenating the return value of the toUpperCase and slice method) and return the value of this new string from the function. The global variable capitalizedWord is then assigned to this value.

In the case of exclaim however, the definition and use of a word parameter has a big difference in the final output. When we invoke the exclaim function on line 11 we pass in capitalizedWord as an argument. At this point capitalizedWord and the word parameter in the scope of the function both have the same value 'Hello', though at different places in memory. We then reassign the parameter word to a new string 'Hello!!!' which is its initial value concatenated with the string '!!!'. Note that this doesn't affect the value of the global variable word declared on line 9 since the parameter 'shadows' and blocks access to this variable. The value of the new string 'Hello!!!' is then returned by the function, and it is this value to which exclaimedWord is assigned.

After our function invocations, word still has its initial value of 'hello', capitalizedWord has the value of 'Hello' which was returned by the capitalize function invocation, and exclaimedWord has a value of 'Hello!!!' which was returned by the exclaim function invocation. It is these values we see when we log the three variables on lines 13-15.
